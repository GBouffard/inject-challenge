I tried test by test and it was working fine. Then suddenly my 2nd test, the times one stopped working. I know why and what happens but couldn't correct it with my actual ruby language knowledge. Teachers said I did well for a 2nd week exercise and advised me to go back to the challenge later; once I will have more ruby knowledge, I should be able to solve.
